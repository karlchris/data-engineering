# Spark Optimizations

![spark-optimizations](../pics/spark-optimizations.png)

Spark is commonly used to apply transformations on data, structured in most cases.
There are 2 scenarios in which it is particularly useful.

!!! tip

    When the data to be processed is too large for the available computing and memory resources.

Finally, it is also an alternative when one wants to accelerate calculation by using several machines within the same network.
In both cases, a major concern is to optimize the calculation time of a Spark job.

In response to this problem, we often increase the resources allocated to a computing cluster.

But, in order to avoid an exhaustive search for the best configuration settings, which is naturally very costly, we will exhibit actionable solutions to maximise our chances of reducing computation time.

Each step will be materialized by a recommandation, as justified as possible.

More other table join strategies are available in Spark Databricks, [Optimizing Apache Spark SQL Joins](https://databricks.com/fr/session/optimizing-apache-spark-sql-joins).

## Use the Apache Parquet file format

The [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format is officially a column-oriented storage. Actually, it's more of a hybrid format between row and column storage.

It's used for tabular data. Data in the same column are stored contiguously.

![column oriented storage](../pics/column-oriented-storage.png)

This format is particularly suitable when performing queries (transformations) on a subset of columns and on a large dataframe. This is because it loads only the data associated with the required columns into memory.

Moreover, as the compression scheme and the encoding are specific to each column according to the typing, it improves the reading / writing of these binary files and their size on disk.

These advantages make it a very interesting alternative to the CSV format. This is the format recommended by Spark and the default format for writing.

## Maximise parallelism in Spark

Spark’s efficiency is based on its ability to process several tasks in parallel at scale.
Therefore, the more we facilitate the division into tasks, the faster they will be completed. This is why optimizing a Spark job often means reading and processing as much data as possible in parallel.

And to achieve this goal, it is necessary to split a dataset into several partitions.

Partitioning a dataset is a way of arranging the data into configurable, readable subsets of contiguous data blocks on disk. These partitions can then be read and processed independently and in parallel. It is this independence that enables massive data processing.

Ideally, Spark organises one thread per task and per CPU core. Each task is related to a single partition. Thus, a first intuition is to configure a number of partitions at least as large as the number of available CPU cores.

All cores should be occupied most of the time during the execution of the Spark job. If one of them is available at any time, it should be able to process a job associated with a remaining partition.

The goal is to avoid bottlenecks by splitting the Spark job stages into a large number of tasks. This fluidity is crucial in a distributed computing cluster.

The following diagram illustrates this division between the machines in the network.

![parallelism](../pics/parallelism.png)

Partitions can be created:

- When reading the data by setting the `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` parameter (default is 128 MB).

A good situation is when the data is already stored in several partitions on disk. For example, a dataset in parquet format with a folder containing data partition files between 100 and 150 MB in size.

- Directly in the Spark application code using the Dataframe API.

```python
dataframe.repartition(100)
dataframe.coalesce(100)
```

This last method `coalesce` decreases the number of partitions while avoiding a `shuffle` in the network.

!!! warning

    One might be tempted to increase the number of partitions by lowering the value of the `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` parameter.
    
    However, this choice can lead to the **small file problem**.
    
    There is a deterioration of I/O performance due to the operations performed by the file system (e.g. opening, closing, listing files), which is often amplified with a distributed file system like *HDFS*.
    
    Scheduling problems can also be observed if the number of partitions is too large.

## Beware of Shuffle Operations

There is a specific type of partition in Spark called a **shuffle partition**. 
These partitions are created during the stages of a job involving a shuffle, i.e. when a **wide transformation** (e.g. `groupBy()`, `join()`) is performed.
The setting of these partitions impacts both the network and the read/write disk resources.

The value of `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` can be modified to control the number of partitions.

!!! info

    By default, this is set to 200, which may be too high for some processing, and results in too many partitions being exchanged in the network between the executing nodes.

    This parameter should be adjusted according to the size of the data.

!!! tip

    An intuition might be to start with a value at least equal to the number of CPU cores in the cluster.

Spark stores the intermediate results of a shuffle operation on the local disks of the executor machines, so the quality of the disks, especially the I/O quality, is really important.

!!! example

    the use of SSD disks will significantly improve performance for this type of transformation.

The table below describes the main parameters that we can also influence.

![spark table](../pics/spark-table.png)

## Use Broadcast Hash Join

A join between several dataframe is a common operation.

In a distributed context, a large amount of data is exchanged in the network between the executing nodes to perform the join.

Depending on the size of the tables, this exchange causes network latency, which slows down processing.

Spark offers several join strategies to optimise this operation. One of them is particularly interesting if it can be chosen: `Broadcast Hash Join (BHJ)`.

!!! tip

    This technique is suitable when **one of the merged dataframe is “sufficiently” small to be duplicated in memory on all the executing nodes** (broadcast operation). The diagram below illustrates how this strategy works.

![broadcast hash join](../pics/broadcast-hash-join.png)

By duplicating the smallest table, **the join no longer requires any significant data exchange in the cluster apart from the broadcast of this table beforehand**. 

This strategy greatly improves the speed of the join. The Spark configuration parameter to modify is `spark.sql.autoBroadcastHashJoin`.

!!! tip

    The default value is 10 MB, i.e. this method is chosen if one of the two tables is smaller than this size.
    
    If sufficient memory is available, it may be very useful to increase this value or set it to -1 to force Spark to use it.

## Cache intermediate results

To optimise its computations and manage memory resources, Spark uses *lazy evaluation* and a DAG to describe a job.

This offers the possibility of quickly **recalculating the steps before an action if necessary**, and thus executing only part of the DAG.

To take full advantage of this functionality, it is very wise to **store expensive intermediate results** if several operations use them downstream of the DAG.

Indeed, if an action is run, its computation can be based on these intermediate results and thus only replay a sub-part of the DAG before this action.

following DAG as example

![spark dag](../pics/spark-dag.png)

To obtain the results of the 2 actions, the treatments are described in the 2 DAGs below.

![2 dags](../pics/2-dags.png)

In order to speed up the execution, one can decide to cache intermediate results (e.g. the result of a join)

![1st action](../pics/1st-action.png)

The processing of the second action is now simplified.

!!! note

    During the first action, the results have not yet been stored in memory.

![2nd action](../pics/2nd-action.png)

!!! tip

    If this caching can speed up execution of a job, we pay a **cost when these results are written to memory and/or disk**.
    
    It should be tested at different locations in the processing pipeline whether the total time saving outweighs the cost.
    
    This is especially relevant when there are several paths on the DAG.

!!! note

    Caching, like any Spark transformation, is performed when an action is run. 
    
    If the computation of this action involves only a sub-part of the data, then only the intermediate results for that sub-part will be stored.

A table can be cached using the following command

```python
dataframe.persist(storageLevel="MemoryOnly")
```

The different caching options are described in the table below

![caching table](../pics/caching-table.png)

## Manage the memory of the executor nodes

The memory of a Spark executor is broken down as follows

![spark executor memory](../pics/spark-executor-memory.png)

By default, the `spark.memory.fraction` parameter is set to 0.6.

This means that 60% of the memory is allocated for execution and 40% for storage, once the reserved memory is removed.

This is 300 MB by default and is used to prevent **out of memory (OOM)** errors.

We can modify the following 2 parameters:

- `spark.executor.memory`
- `spark.memory.fraction`

## Partitioning

Partitioning in Spark refers to the division of data into smaller, more manageable chunks known as `partitions`.
Partitions are the basic units of parallelism in Spark, and they allow the framework to process different portions of the data simultaneously on different nodes in a cluster.

### Why partition data?

Partitioning serves several essential purposes in Spark:

- **Parallelism**

By dividing data into partitions, Spark can distribute these partitions across multiple nodes in a cluster. This enables parallel processing, significantly improving the performance of data operations.

- **efficient data processing**

Smaller partitions are easier to manage and manipulate. When a specific operation is performed on a partition, it affects a smaller subset of the data, reducing memory overhead.

- **data locality**

Spark aims to process data where it resides. By creating partitions that align with the distribution of data across nodes, Spark can optimize data locality, minimizing data transfer over the network.

Spark uses 2 types of partitioning:

### Partitioning in memory

While transfrorming data Spark allows users to control partitioning explicitly by using `repartition` or `coalesce`.

#### repartition

- It allows to specify the desired number of partitions and the column(s) to partition by.
- It shuffles the data to create the specified number of partitions.

#### coalesce

- It reduces the number of partitions by merging them.
- It’s useful when you want to decrease the number of partitions for efficiency.

!!! info

    By default, Spark/PySpark creates partitions that are equal to the number of CPU cores in the machine.

!!! example

    We repartition data into 4 partitions based on a column named `sex`.

    ```python
    df = df.repartition(4, "sex")
    print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())
    ```

### Partitioning on disk

When writing data in Spark, the `partitionBy()` method is used to partition the data into a file system, resulting in multiple sub-directories.

> This partitioning enhances the read performance for downstream systems.

The function can be applied to one or multiple column values while writing a DataFrame to the disk. 
Based on these values, Spark splits the records according to the partition column and stores the data for each partition in a respective sub-directory.

In the following code, we are saving data to the file system in parquet format, partitioning it based on the `sex` column.

```python
df.write.mode("overwrite").partitionBy("sex").parquet("data/output")
```

Output

## Bucketing

Bucketing is a technique used in Spark for optimizing data storage and querying performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. It involves dividing data into a fixed number of buckets and storing each bucket as a separate file.

### Why bucket data?

- **Efficient Data Retrieval**

When querying data, Spark can narrow down the search by reading only specific buckets, reducing the amount of data to scan. This results in faster query performance.

- **Uniform Bucket Sizes**

Bucketing ensures that each bucket contains approximately the same number of records, preventing data skew.

### How to bucket data

Bucketing is typically applied to DataFrames or tables using the `bucketBy` method in Spark SQL. You specify the number of buckets and the column to bucket by.

!!! example

    we create 5 buckets based on a column named `age` then we write data to a table named `bucketed_table`

    ```python
    df.write.bucketBy(5, "age").saveAsTable("bucketed_table")
    ```

    You can also specify sorting within buckets, which can further optimize certain query types

    ```python
    df.write.bucketBy(10, "age")\
        .sortBy("name")\
        .saveAsTable("sorted_bucketed_table")
    ```

## Choosing between **partitioning** and **bucketing**

The decision of whether to use partitioning or bucketing (or both) in your Spark application depends on the specific use case and query patterns.

![partitioning-bucketing](../pics/partitioning-bucketing.png)

Here are some guidelines:

- **Partitioning**

when you need to distribute data for parallel processing and optimize data locality. It’s beneficial for `filtering` and `joins` where the filter condition aligns with the partition key.

- **Bucketing**

when you have large datasets and want to optimize query performance, especially for equality-based filters. It’s beneficial for scenarios where data is frequently queried with specific criteria.
You are supposed to use bucketing while the column cardinality is quite high, means data variance is a lot, using partitioning in this type of data will create a lot of files, leads to `small files problem`.

- **Combining Both**

In some cases, combining partitioning and bucketing can yield the best results. You can partition data by a high-level category and then bucket it within each partition.

## PySpark code

!!! warning

    to run following code, you need to have write access to the writing directory or external locations, such as: `S3 bucket` or `GCS`.

    You also might need to setup connections to the `Hive Metastore`.

Here is an example of pyspark code

```python
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('partition-bucket-app').getOrCreate()

df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [("person_1", "20"), ("person_2", "56"), ("person_3", "89"), ("person_4", "20")],
    ["name","age"]
)

# Partitionning
df = df.repartition(4, "age")
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())

# Coalesce
df = df.coalesce(2)
print(df.rdd.getNumPartitions())

# PartitionBy
df.write.mode("overwrite").partitionBy("age").csv("data/output")

# Bucketing 
df.write.bucketBy(5, "age").saveAsTable("bucketed_table")

df.write.bucketBy(10, "age")\
    .sortBy("name")\
    .saveAsTable("sorted_bucketed_table")
```
