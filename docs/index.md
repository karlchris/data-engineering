## Overview

- Data Engineering
- Data Modeling
- Data Architecture
- Data Orchestration

!!! quote

    My perspective is that data architecture is like an ever-evolving river.
    It’s like the Mississippi River, the Mississippi River from one day to the next is never the same.
    It’s always changing. The same goes to data architecture. What’s happened is Data Warehousing applies to structured transaction-based data.
    That’s really the heart of data warehousing, but there’s other data in the corporation that’s viable and important data as well.
