# Data Engineering Notes

Hello everyone :wave:

SELAMAT DATANG !!! (1)
{ .annotate }

1. _Selamat datang_ is "welcome" in Indonesia :indonesia: language. :green_heart:

I am **Karl Christian**, an experienced data guy.

I will share my knowledge repository for almost 7+ years of my working experience around Data and especially Data Engineering.
You will find out about what skill set we should have as Data Engineer.

I have experiences as **data engineer**, **data warehousing** and about **analytics engineering**. :speech_balloon:

## Overview

!!! tip

   First, I bring up some exciting projects about data engineering, check it out here [projects](projects/README.md).

> I assure it's easy to follow even for beginners.

If you want to deep dive into the topics and get basic/advance understandings, I suggest you go through the **learning** tabs, such as below:

- Data Engineering
- Data Modeling
- Data Architecture
- Data Orchestration
- Data Ingestion
- Data Processing
- Data Quality
- Learning Python
- Many more

Stay tune to this notes, I will keep updating it to the most recent Data Engineering updates.

!!! quote

    My perspective is that data architecture is like an ever-evolving river.
    It’s like the Mississippi River, the Mississippi River from one day to the next is never the same.
    It’s always changing. The same goes to data architecture. What’s happened is Data Warehousing applies to structured transaction-based data.
    That’s really the heart of data warehousing, but there’s other data in the corporation that’s viable and important data as well.
