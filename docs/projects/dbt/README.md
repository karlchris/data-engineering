# Running **dbt** and **Google BigQuery** using **Docker**

!!! warning "must have"

    Before starting this project, you need to install some prerequisites in your laptop:

    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    - [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    - [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Interact with Google Cloud Platform

- Create your project, follow this [guidances](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

- Enter your [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and go to BigQuery.
  You will find view as below, your **[project name]** is within the **red box**.

![bigquery view](../pics/bigquery-view.png)

- In your GCP project, create dataset name `data_eng`.

- Go to your local terminal and run command below, it will redirect you to browser and login to your google account and create the credentials file to your laptop.

> Credentials saved to file: [~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

- Done, your laptop is connected to GCP and you can connect it through container as well.

## Build dbt docker image

- clone the repo first, run this command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karlchris/data-engineering.git
```

- update your dbt [profiles.yml](profiles/profiles.yml) with your GCP **[project name]**

```yaml
data-eng:
  target: dev

  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: [project name]
      dataset: "data_eng"
      timeout_seconds: 300
      location: US
      priority: interactive
      retries: 0
      threads: 8
```

- make sure you are in `data-engineering directory`, then run this command

```bash
make build-dbt
```

```bash

- if you see above image, then your dbt image is already built.

## Run dbt image container interactively

- run this command to execute dbt image and enter in `/bin/bash` terminal,

```bash
make run-dbt
```

Output:

```bash
➜  data-engineering git:(dq1) ✗ make run-dbt
Running dbt in container
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

```

- run this command to execute `dbt run` in FULL REFRESH mode.

```bash
dbt run --full-refresh
```

Output:

```bash

```

- your models have been run based on the dependencies and SQL models.

- you can check in the BigQuery UI for the created tables.

## Check dbt docs and DAG

- Inside your container, in your terminal, run this command to compile dbt models, etc

```bash
dbt compile --target dev
```

Output:

```bash
root@d94bac5d04ab:/dbt# dbt compile --target dev
17:27:26  Running with dbt=1.0.0
17:27:26  Unable to do partial parsing because config vars, config profile, or config target have changed

17:27:28

```

- run this command to generate docs.

```bash
dbt docs generate --target dev
```

Output:

```bash
root@d94bac5d04ab:/dbt# dbt docs generate --target dev
17:27:48  Running with dbt=1.0.0

```

- run this command to serve the docs into UI.

```bash
dbt docs serve --target dev
```

Output:

```bash
root@d94bac5d04ab:/dbt# dbt docs serve --target dev
17:28:13  Running with dbt=1.0.0
17:28:13  Serving docs at 0.0.0.0:8080
17:28:13  To access from your browser, navigate to:  http://localhost:8080
17:28:13
17:28:13
17:28:13  Press Ctrl+C to exit.
```

- the UI is accessible in port `8080` inside the container, but in my Makefile, I redirect it to port `8082`, then you can access it in [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) through your browser.

```makefile
run-dbt:
	@echo "Running dbt in container"
	@docker run \
		-e DESTINATION=${USER} \
		-e DBT_ENV=dev \
		--rm \
		-v ${GCP_AUTH}:/creds -it \
		--entrypoint /bin/bash \
		-p 8082:8080 \
		dbt
```

- you can see the DAG lineage through the URL as below

![dag lineage](../pics/dag-lineage.png)

and you can also see each of dbt models informations, such as: details, descriptions, column and code.

![dbt ui](../pics/dbt-ui.png)
