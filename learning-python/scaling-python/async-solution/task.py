"""
    Problem
        When a webpage loads, its base HTML page has a bunch of resources that the browser needs to fetch in order to display the page completely.
        However, the time that the browser takes to fetch all those resources determines its quality.

    In this challenge, suppose you are writing code for building a browser.
    You have to fetch three URLs: http://educative.io, http://educative.io/blog, and http://youtube.com.

    Hint: You can use asyncio and aiohttp.
"""

## Import other libraries if you want (asyncio and aiohttp are supported)
import time

urls = ["http://educative.io", "http://educative.io/blog", "http://youtube.com"]
