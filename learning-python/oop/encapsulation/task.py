            name
            rollNumber
    
        Include the following methods to get and set the private properties above:
            getName()
            setName()
            getRollNumber()
            setRollNumber()
    
        Implement this class according to the rules of encapsulation.

    Input
        Checking all the properties and methods

    Output
        Expecting perfectly defined fields and getter/setters

    Note: Do not use initializers to initialize the properties. Use the set methods to do so. If the setter is not defined properly, the corresponding getter will also generate an error even if the getter is defined properly.
